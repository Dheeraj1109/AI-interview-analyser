# AI Interview Analyzer

A web-based tool that helps users simulate and analyze mock interviews. Users can either **record** their responses or **upload** audio files, which are then analyzed to evaluate performance.

## 🔍 Features

- 🎙️ **Record Audio**: Use your microphone to record interview responses.
- 📤 **Upload Audio**: Upload pre-recorded responses for analysis.
- 🌐 **Web Interface**: Clean and intuitive HTML/CSS/JS-based frontend.
- 📊 **(Pluggable Backend)**: Placeholder for integrating AI models for transcription, analysis, and feedback.

## 📁 File Structure


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
- A microphone (for the recording feature).

### Running the App

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Choose either:
   - **Record**: Navigate to the recording page and start speaking.
   - **Upload**: Go to the upload page and select an audio file.

> Note: This is a frontend-only prototype. Backend logic for transcription and AI analysis must be implemented separately.

## 🧠 To Do / Extend

- Integrate a backend for:
  - Speech-to-text transcription.
  - Embedding generation (e.g., using Gemini AI or OpenAI).
  - Interview response evaluation (e.g., using Pinecone similarity search).
- Display feedback and scoring based on answers.
